# What is Project_RAT?

Project_RAT is a remote access trojan made in **Python 3** witch allow you to:

* Take screenshots
* Record audio
* Execute code
* Recieve files from the victim computer

This project is still in development and needs some improvement in the current functionality

## How it works?

1. Download the code
`git clone https://github.com/VictorAlonsoCM/Project_RAT.git`

2. Install the requirements
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

3. Using two terminals, start the *client.py* code first and then in the other *server.py*
This code works with **Python 3**

## TODO

* Cipher communication
* Multi-session support
* Improve the Code Execution module
* Realtime video transmission
* And much more
